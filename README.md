## How do you set up this thing? well:
 * 1 Make a .h(header) file in your project.
 * 2 Add the code in the file.
 * 3 Make sure to include your file with "#include "header_file_name.h"".
 * 4 You are done, now read how to use it.
## How do you use this now?:
 * 1 Use "write" to write process memory, example:
 > write<uintptr_t>(handle, adress, $value, sizeof(value));
 * 2 Use "read" to read process memory, example:
 > read<uintptr_t>(handle, adress, &value, sizeof(value));
 * 3 Use "GetHandle" to get a handle to the process, example:
 > HANDLE handle = GetHandle("ProcessName");
 * Remember you can use <int> or other methods(depends on what you are doing)
